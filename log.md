### Day 1: October 30, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**:
- Learned how to use git and GitHub.
- Added my work so far on my tribute page for Alan Watts to my GitHub repository.

**Thoughts**:

Feels good to finally understand how git and GitHub. Only took 2 - 3 hours but I had been putting it off since I thought it was more difficult. Also want to thank the community around this challenge that already has showed support for me just saying: "I'm doing this". Tomorrow I want to keep improving on my tribute page.

### Day 2: October 31, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:
- Built a website with my social media links. Hosting with GitHub Pages and added custom domain.

**Thoughts**:

I did not continue on the tribute page since I got so sidetracked by making my first version of jespancer.com. I will get back to working on the freeCodeCamp project tomorrow.

### Day 3: November 1, Thursday

**Today's Progress**:
- Fixed DNS problem and have my personal website up and running.
- Did some changes to my Alan Watts tribute page. (Look at past version to fix current problem with footer.)

**Thoughts**:

Did not get a CodePen up for my tribute page. I think I will get it up when I am done with the page instead, too much work.

### Day 6: November 4, Sunday

**Today's Progress**:
- Pretty much done with the tribute page.

**Thoughts**:

Have tried to make my code as clean as possible. I did not try learning everything for this one project, instead I focused on repeating and improving my fundamentals with HTML and CSS. In the next project I have new things I want to learn and implement.

### Day 9: November 7, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:
- Completed my survey form.

**Thoughts**:

It's pretty basic. I might actually add something like this, more fleshed out to my actual website in the future. My CSS is really compact at least.

### Day 13: November 11, Sunday

**Today's Progress**:
- Working on page where I sell my service as a Web Developer (Product Landing Page).
- Made a short video of me coding with classical music to add to the website.

**Thoughts**:

I think I have hit that first wall when trying to do achieve something great. I had the first 10 days be a breeze. I had the favor of novelty of joining the #100DaysOfCode challenge. I am not going to give up. I just have to accept that: this is my job. It's not meant to be fun all the time and let it be as it is. Sometimes I will find it very fulfilling other times like I am imprisoned. That is just the nature of choosing a career. You set boundaries to get good at something instead of nothing.

### Day 14: November 12, Monday

**Today's Progress**:
- Got the structure of Product Landing Page done.

**Thoughts**:

Scrapped the idea of using full on Grid for this project since it just is not important for this project and Flexbox works great for it. Today I felt more motivated to work and got a lot done.

### Day 15: November 13, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**:
- Better colors
- Wrote the text
- Checks all the boxes for freeCodeCamp
- Media queries

**Thoughts**:

My Product Landing Page is decent and ready to be published but I think I can do better so I will give it at least tomorrow to polish it. Clean up code and make it look prettier.

### Day 17: November 15, Thursday

**Today's Progress**:
- FreeCodeCamp project: "Technical Documentation Page" complete.
- Watched video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azcrPFhaY9k

**Thoughts**:

Took me about 4 hours to complete it. Used the same content that the example had and tried to look at the example and replicate a lot of it. Also then read the example code and tired to understand why it was coded in that way.

The video I watched made me understand better what programming really is and how I need to start doing it.

### Day 18: November 16, Friday

**Today's Progress**:

### Day 20: November 18, Sunday

**Today's Progress**:
- Acquired the Responsive Web Design certificate.

**Thoughts**:

Feeling good to finally have the certificate but most importantly I feel that I now have a good understanding on HTML and CSS. I am used to it and create responsive websites really fast.
