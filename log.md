### Day 1: October 30, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**:
- Learned how to use git and GitHub.
- Added my work so far on my tribute page for Alan Watts to my GitHub repository.

**Thoughts**:

Feels good to finally understand how git and GitHub. Only took 2 - 3 hours but I had been putting it off since I thought it was more difficult. Also want to thank the community around this challenge that already has showed support for me just saying: "I'm doing this". Tomorrow I want to keep improving on my tribute page.

### Day 2: October 31, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:
- Built a website with my social media links. Hosting with GitHub Pages and added custom domain.

**Thoughts**:

I did not continue on the tribute page since I got so sidetracked by making my first version of jespancer.com. I will get back to working on the freeCodeCamp project tomorrow.
